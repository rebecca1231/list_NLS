Works similarly to the the 'ls' commmand on the CLI.
Files/folders are color-coded.  Files are light blue, folders are magenta.
Colors can be changed utilizing Chalk (npm).
This can be run from anywhere on the CLI.  

To make it run:
    in terminal: 
        chmod +x index.js
        npm link

    code:
        in index.js: #!/usr/bin/env node
        in json "bin": {"nls": "index.js"}
